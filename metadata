To create the domain specfic subset files:
------------------------------------------
* First, if not using 2016KDD.., use filterPAA.py (or, more correctly, filterPapers.py - name was updated in later sets) to filter Papers.txt to get ...SelectedAuthors.txt (This is currently on the EC2 instance)
* Then use filterMAG.py  to filter PaperAuthorAffiliations.txt
* Then use filterMAGauthor.py to filter Authors.txt...
* Then, use getEthnicitiesTextmap.py to query textmap for the author ethnicities

Good luck!
